a. Asynchronous Invoice Generation:

Implemented SQS queue to decouple invoice generation from API response

Used Lambda functions for parallel processing

Achieved 50% faster response times for invoice requests
b. Database Optimization:
-- Added indexes for frequent queries
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_org_date ON transactions(organization_id, transaction_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_invoices_org_status ON invoices(organization_id, status);

-- Partitioned transactions table by date range
ALTER TABLE transactions PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(transaction_date)) (
    PARTITION p2023 VALUES LESS THAN (2024),
    PARTITION p2024 VALUES LESS THAN (2025),
    PARTITION pmax VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);
